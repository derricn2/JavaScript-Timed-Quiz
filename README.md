# JavaScript-Timed-Quiz

Bootcamp Challenge 04 - Web API's: A timed quiz on coding

## The Challenge

Create a timed quiz based on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores that can gauge the progress of those who takes the quiz.

Acceptance Criteria for the webpage:
- While on the homepage of the quiz, I will be able to click the start button and a timer will start counting down and I will be presented with a question
- Once I answer that question, another question will should be presented, and if I answer incorrectly, time will be reduced
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the quiz/game is over
- Once the game is over, I can save over my initials and my score

## Mock-Up

To meet the acceptance criteria, the following had to be done:
- understanding JavaScript terminology well enough to navigate through the how's and why's behind JavaScript codes/terms
- extensive research on applying all lessons learned on JavaScript
- troubleshoot the smallest issues to get the basic functionality working
